Stolen Medical Supplies||||"One of our cargo transports on route to Sector 0 was overwhelmed by outlaws. From what we’ve been able to discern, they were targeting the ship’s cargo—specifically medical supplies. Reports indicate the outlaw ship was heading towards a planet called Meuva 7. There is a good chance the medical supplies are being stored in an old terraforming station at that location. We need you and your crew to travel to Meuva 7, investigate what you can and bring back those supplies."||||0||||4
Destroy Outlaw Camp||||"The shipping logs you provided were key in revealing two other locations used by the outlaw group. We assume at least one of those locations is harboring the outlaws themselves. They cannot be allowed to strike again. We need you to go onsite and remove the outlaws by any means necessary."||||25||||3
Eliminate Outlaw Headquarters||||"We suspect the other location in the shipping logs is sheltering the last outlaws. It appears to be their main base of operation and may contain the rest of the stolen medical supplies, as well. We need you to eliminate the base and find those meds."||||68||||3
Hunt the Resolution||||"After a deeper investigation, we have gathered undeniable evidence that a Colonial Union crew is at the center of the ambushes on our transport vessels. Harming Colonial Union citizens and intercepting medical shipments are unforgivable crimes. The Command Center has given an order for you to eliminate Captain Yolsef and the crew of his ship, the Resolution."||||69||||2
Locate Research Team||||"A friend of mine was working with a research team on a recently discovered planet. I was their sole contact at Outpost 448, since they had been trying to keep their discovery a secret from other research teams on base. However, I haven’t received word from them in a few weeks now. I’m getting concerned that something went wrong on that planet. Could you go there and find them?"||||71||||3
Artifact Retrieval||||"I have a contact who is willing to pay generously for alien artifacts. Recently, I may have stumbled upon the location of some ruins, fairly undisturbed. They will undoubtedly contain just the kind of artifacts my interested buyer is looking for. Very valuable. Priceless, even. If you bring me an artifact from that location, I’ll handle the tedious details of the exchange and give you a slice of the profit."||||72||||3

Retrieve Thermal Regulator||||"You see, the cold is eating through my legs. Until I can get my heating unit back up and running, there’s no way for me to move very far. What I need is a thermal regulator. There’s one in a nearby station, just a ways from here. If you can go in my stead, bring back the thermal regulator I need to repair the heating unit, I’ll give you a tidy sum of credits. Plus, you can keep whatever else you find out there."||||582||||3
Borthix Trade||||"…I’m looking for something. A crystal, called borthix. If you manage to get your hands on a couple samples, I’ll buy from you. Just keep your lips tight about it. Understand?"||||683||||2
Artifact Retrieval II||||"I’ve happened upon another location that houses an alien artifact, much like the previous one you procured for me. I’ll provide you with its coordinates. Go retrieve it. Now, there’s a small catch—we may not be the first ones to have discovered it. But a little healthy competition never did any harm, correct? Yes, of course. Do your best to secure that artifact. And don’t come back here without it."||||780||||3
Scavenge for a Battery||||"I’m in dire need of a battery. Working here as long as I have, I know there’s bound to be one unused somewhere in those wastes. But I absolutely refuse to leave my bunker. You’ve seen those wretched, buzzing things outside, haven’t you? They're awful creatures. The last time I mustered enough courage to go out there, they damaged my battery cell. I desperately require a replacement. Find one for me, yes? I’d be tremendously in your debt. And if you manage to exterminate a few of those flying vermin along the way, all the better. I sure won’t miss them."||||896||||3
Stormproof the Base||||"There's a foul storm brewing, and we have to get this base fortified as soon as possible. The crashed ship nearby is bound to have a few supplies that could be helpful to us. Rations, batteries, pieces of old hull, and even scrap metal would be greatly appreciated."||||1020||||5
Sensor Repair||||"I don’t get much help around the outpost. It can be a difficult place to manage with so few hands. If you’re looking to earn some extra credits, you could retrieve the sensors that are spread out around the perimeter of the outpost. We use the sensors to keep a watchful eye on the native critters, but it’s been a while since we’ve performed maintenance on a good number of those sensors. They’re due for repairs. If you just bring the batteries in for me, it’d be a tremendous help."||||2368||||3
Research Specimens||||"From what I know of Sargastia Tribulen, your best chance to find it would be on a planet with an acidic atmosphere. It’s usually a green, gelatinous substance that gives off a faint glow. As for Waxthorn, it is most likely to be found on planets that are arid or extremely hot. The thorn on the Waxthorn’s pod has been known to cause unpredictable and even lethal effects. Please, exercise caution and it shouldn’t pose you any harm. When you acquire both research samples, bring them back here. I’ll pay you well for all your trouble."||||2437||||3
Artifact Retrieval III||||"You may have already guessed, but I have my eyes set on another ancient curiosity. And given your successful performance in the past, you are most certainly the crew to go fetch it. According to my source, it may take a little…effort to get to the artifact. But you’re a capable lot! I wholeheartedly believe you can surmount whatever hellfire might be thrown at you. Good luck. And don’t make me wait too long."||||2580||||3
Clean the Generators||||"The generator room was contaminated with greywrack a few weeks back. That stuff spreads fast and is almost impossible to get rid of, so we have to keep cleaning it out every couple days. The generator room is in the tall spherical building outside. My sensors indicate there are six large spots of greywrack. Just pick them up, bring them back here, and I'll dispose of them."||||6867||||3
Sandshark Research||||"A little ways from my lab, there’s a rocky nest right on the edge of sandshark territory. I believe an egg was laid there just a few days ago, and I need it for my research. Get it for me, and I’ll pay you a few credits."||||8353||||3
Clear the Mines||||"We are in great need of assistance right now. Not long ago, our miners discovered a large deposit of an alien ore in the caves. The ore emitted a strange noise when they first unearthed it, and none of our equipment was able to remove little more than stray fragments from the central vein. Earlier today, insect-like creatures burrowed their way through the mines and have now taken it over. They seem drawn to that strange ore. I don’t know what to do about the ore, but if nothing is done to rid of those creatures, I fear we could lose the mines entirely."||||8587||||3
Collect an Egg||||"As you may have already noticed, this planet is home to some rather intriguing creatures. Although my initial interests were in the flora of this world, I’ve since become fascinated by the native animals living in the area. I’d like to study them—in particular, their embryonic development—but I haven’t been able to get close to one of their nests. That’s where you come in. I want to borrow one of the animals’ eggs. Since I don’t have an Atrium, I can’t afford the risk of retrieving an egg myself. If you could find an egg and bring it back for me, I’ll pay you 2,000 credits."||||17355||||3
Retrieve Ore Sample||||"With the native creatures being so attracted to the ore, I haven’t been able to leave the inside of the station for some time now. I would never be able to fend them off myself. Another sample of the ore is all I need to continue my research. If you go through the main doors on this level of the station, you’ll find yourself in the cave system where the ore pillars are located. Any loosened fragment of the ore will do nicely."||||18063||||3
Clear the Crash Site||||"Competitors of ours crash-landed a ship nearby and have been persistently attacking our facility. Our work has slowed to a halt, and their interference is costing us thousands of credits a day. Those bots need to go. If you can get rid of them, you can walk out of here with another 3,000 credits to your name."||||18064||||3
Find Sensor Logs||||"My colleagues decided to step through the portal and gather data from the other side. We hoped that with such information, we could discover a way to close it once and for all. But they never returned. I fear something terrible happened to them, but I know if I enter the rift I won't stand a chance. If you think you handle whatever is on the other side of the portal, please, find those sensor logs and bring them back to me. I need to put an end to this before it's too late."||||21982||||3
Scour for IU-03020||||"You need to retrieve three samples of a research material called ‘IU-03020’. It should look like a blue crystal. Samples of IU-03020 are difficult to find, but the Corporation needs them for the development of a project. From what I understand, they can be formed in subterranean systems. Find those samples and bring them back with haste."||||25249||||2
Check Comms Tower||||"You have a flight pack, correct? If you’re any good with it, could you fly to the top of the station and check the comms tower for me? We’ve been having some problems with our communications array, so we need to climb up there to see what went wrong. The process would go a lot faster with your help. Plus, I’d be willing to part with a few credits in exchange for your help."||||31398||||3
Help the Terraforming Station||||"A storm swept through here not too long ago, and it revealed a rocky hole in the ground near the station. When we lowered a cord down to investigate it, we discovered a small cave and saw something glowing deeper inside. However, we didn’t get a good look at it before the drones swarmed us. Ever since we found that cave, the drones have been circling the station and setting off our sensors. It’s becoming difficult to get work done, and we still don’t know what that glowing object was. If you’re willing to do me a favor, clear out the drones around the station and bring back that glowing object from the cave. I’ll pay you 2000 credits."||||31399||||4

Clear X-59 Alpha Route||||"Recently, two W.D. hunting units were placed in a sector that happened to be a vital part of a smuggling route called X-59 Alpha. The units engage in combat with any ship that enters the sector, and as a result have taken out several Alliance smuggling vessels. The Caretaker has declared these hunting ships marked for elimination. Whoever gets rid of the W.D. hunting units will be paid 7,000 credits."||||10112||||2
Subdue Raider Band||||"A certain raider band called the Boltacks has gotten out of hand. They've been attacking other Gentlemen and threatening to expose the Estate. According to word from the top, the Caretaker just put a bounty on their heads. Take down those raiders, and you'll be awarded 10,000 credits."||||10113||||2
Smuggle Medical Supplies||||"The Estate needs a Gentlemen crew to smuggle a shipment of medical supplies out of Outpost 448. There's an associate at the station who should have the supplies prepared.

It was one of the rare moments in my life that I was a poor judge of character. Needless to say, the bastard ran off with the credits and has foiled my every attempt to get them back. I've had enough with these games. It's no longer about the credits anymore. The reputation of my establishment is at stake. I need to make an example of this fool. If you're willing to get your hands dirty, you're just the type of crew I need for this operation. Deal with The Wonderment in any way you please, and speak with me when you've finished the job."||||11926||||2

Raid a Gentleman's Stash||||"If you want to make some fast credits, I may have a job for you. You see, I know of a raider captain who stashes his pilfered goods at an old planetary base in the galaxy. Now, the captain is crafty with hologram technology, so don't trust everything you see. The item I want looks like a metal sphere with red stripes. If you bring it back to me, I'll pay you 9000 credits. Plus, you can keep whatever else you find in that dump."||||12380||||3
Roy's Favor||||"Could you go over to the reactor room for me? I have a friend there named Am Cotoba. You see, I need a certain material called 'kilnseed' for one of my repairs, but it's pretty hard to come by on this ship. Cotoba uses it down in the reactor room all the time, so he might be able to spare some. Just remind him he owes me for helping him repair that panel he broke the other day. Let me know when you get ahold of that kilnseed, and I'll transfer 5,000 credits over to you."||||12612||||2
Restocking Kilnseed||||"Roy sent you for kilnseed? That's great, but I'm afraid I can't give you any even if I wanted to. You see, I may have...uh...gambled away the last stores of it. It was an honest mistake, I could've sworn I was going to win. But now the Estate is out of kilnseed, and I have no idea how to get more on my own. Since you're here, maybe you can help me? Please, I'll double whatever Roy is paying you. If I don't get this problem fixed discreetly, the Caretaker will wring my neck."||||12613||||3

He was hired to procure an ancient tablet that may hold the key to decoding an alien system of hieroglyphs. The Society is willing to pay 6,000 credits for a ship to go to the station and retrieve the tablet for them. Once you've acquired the tablet, deliver it to Theod Vekius. He will fulfill your payment. He works for the Society of Intergalactic History and resides in one of the rooms in the orange-lit crew quarters of the Estate."||||13301||||4
Retrieve Alien Tablet||||"Ah, yes. You must be the ones that the Society of Intergalactic History sent from the Estate. Well, I have a bit of bad news. My crew had...problems acquiring the tablet. It seems some metal bandits have taken up roost in the structure where the tablet is located. My employees weren't able to get far without those bandits firing on them. They refuse to go back there. If you want that tablet, you're going to have to get it yourselves. I apologize for the trouble. At least let me forward the coordinates to your ship."||||13363||||2
Transport Cryo Chamber||||"A few hundred years ago, it was common practice to cryogenically preserve colonists and wayfarers during intergalactic missions. Cryo facilities were often constructed in fringe galaxies like this one to store and maintain the bodies until they were scheduled to be released. However, settling the frontier comes with great risks. Over the years, many cryo facilities were either destroyed or lost to time. It's my life's work to find them, and I believe I've located one in this galaxy. This cryogenic site, the coordinates of which I'll send to your starmap, may hold a colonist of great interest to me. If you collect his cryo chamber from the facility and bring him back to me, I'll reward you with 10,000 credits."||||14634||||3

Your job is to go to one of our affiliated mining facilities and pick up the borthix. It’ll be two crates, so free up space in your cargo hold. One of the workers down in the Estate’s cargo bay will have a spot open for the crates, conveniently out of the Caretaker’s line of sight. Report to him when you get the stock."||||14639||||3

On a whim, I decided to look outside the Estate for a sundust producer who’ll make me more than a 5 credit profit. Since I don’t own a ship, I need you to hop a few sectors away, meet with the new suppliers, and bring back the stock. Ah, and in fair warning, these new suppliers are a prickly sort.

WANTED: Lortalus||||For the past three Union-standard years, the flagged Intrepid-class starship ‘Lortalus’ has been involved in numerous cases of sabotage and assassination. It is believed to be offering its services for hire, independently of and without regard for any faction. Though confrontations between Lortalus and the Grey Huntsmen have thus far been limited due to Lortalus’s elusiveness, one report speaks of the ship as being ‘deathly silent and virtually undetectable’. Reward of 18,000 credits, funded by the Colonial Union, the Wolden-Dorf Corporation, the Civilian Transport Association, Explorers United, the League of Free Machines and an anonymous requestor.||||27374||||2

Find the Strange Creature||||"There are strange things in the galaxy, many of which remain hidden to all who do not seek them out. However, there is something that we have been trying to track down for quite some time with no success. It is said to be a creature with a great eye that resides in an unmarked sector of space. Only a few have witnessed it, and even fewer have survived such an encounter. If you ever come across the creature in your travels, please let me know. It would be a great addition to our records, and I would surely compensate you for any information you could provide."||||30599||||2

WANTED: U.S.S. Xarius||||Outrider-class 'U.S.S. Xarius' was recently discovered to be involved with a drug smuggling operation led by infamous sundust producer Tam Mora. After the U.S.S. Xarius had a falling out with Mora, its illegal activities were exposed to the Colonial Union Command Center through an anonymous tip. Xarius has since resisted arrest and destroyed all ships that attempted to apprehend it. Recent information has come in pinpointing a possible location of intercept between Xarius and a mercenary vessel called 'The Butcher', which is believed to have been hired by Mora to rid of Xarius. Infighting is expected. Reward of 7,000 credits for U.S.S. Xarius, funded by the Colonial Union.||||45410||||2
WANTED: The Butcher||||'The Butcher' is a Stargazer-class mercenary vessel responsible for an indeterminate number of ship destructions.

WANTED: Crumb Cleaners||||After being at the bottom of the sales chart for several Union-standard days, the Fluffy Biscuit vessel 'Crumb Cleaners' suddenly severed contact with its managers and began attacking any vessels it came into contact with. Several civilian ships have been assaulted by Crumb Cleaners, with one being destroyed. Crumb Cleaners has since been deemed a substantial threat to public safety. It is unknown what triggered such a violent reaction from the crew, though some kind of chemical exposure is suspected. Crumb Cleaners is a Fluffy One-class vessel. Based on reports, it seems to be outfitted with chemical weaponry. Reward of 5,000 credits, funded by the Fluffy Biscuit Company, the Colonial Union, and the Civilian Transport Association.||||45413||||2
WANTED: Unit 10, Div #44||||W.D. Unit 10, Div #44 broke into a restricted W.D. Corporation factory and kidnapped several workers. Due to a zero-cooperation policy regarding extortion, the W.D. Corporation refused to abide by any ransom terms and now believes the kidnapped workers to be dead. Since the Corporation's security drones have been unable to capture or eliminate the kidnappers, the Grey Huntsmen have been enlisted to help. Unit 10, Div #44 is a Cruiser-class starship and is reportedly equipped with a strong shield generator and hull. Reward of 8,000 credits, funded by the W.D. Corporation.||||45414||||2
WANTED: Deathseeker Drone||||A Deathseeker drone that was recently purchased by a collector named Rumibard Warger was mistakenly activated and is running rampant in Colonial Union space. It needs to be deactivated immediately. Deathseeker drones do not have ranged weapons but ram into ships with blades that can rip apart hulls. Reward of 5,000 credits, funded by the Colonial Union.||||45415||||2
WANTED: The Striker||||Destroyer-class starship 'The Striker' is a stolen vessel. Its crew is known for hijacking security drones and other automated weaponry, and they are responsible for massive damages and casualties across the galaxy. Reports state that The Striker recently hacked into a pair of shock drones and has been using them to threaten civilian transports, attacking anyone who does not comply to its demands. Witnesses claim that The Striker is utilizing a lightning turret to attack in tandem with the shock drones. Reward of 9,000 credits, funded by the Colonial Union Sector Defense Division, the Wolden-Dorf Corporation, and the Civilian Transport Association.||||45416||||2
WANTED: The Drafters||||The Drafters are a group of raiders who are highly experienced in mechanical engineering. They attack heavy transport ships and research facilities to steal prototypes of new technology, which they then modify and sell on the black market. They have broken into numerous ships and facilities, killing over two-dozen workers in their attempts to steal experimental technology. A recent report claimed that the Drafters are operating out of a planetary base near your location. Shut down the Drafters' operation to receive the bounty. Reward of 7,000 credits, funded by the Wolden-Dorf Corporation, Dark Star Navigation Inc., and Explorers United.||||45418||||2
WANTED: Biscuit Burners||||The Biscuit Burners are a group of raiders that primarily target Fluffy Biscuit delivery ships and are responsible for nearly a dozen ship destructions. Their persistent attacks on delivery ships have contributed to rising animosity towards the Fluffy Biscuit Company within Cornelia Station, where Fluffy Biscuit crews have already been banned from entry. The Biscuit Burners conduct coordinated strikes against Fluffy Biscuit ships, tracking their delivery routes within a certain range of Cornelia Station. Since the Biscuit Burners are well established, they need to be eliminated at their base of operations on Cornelia Station. Reports indicate that they work out of a gutted Fluffy Biscuit delivery ship within the market section of the station. Reward of 8,000 credits, funded by the Fluffy Biscuit Company.||||45420||||2
Hunt Infected Carrier||||"A while ago, my friend's ship was caught too close to a black hole and was forced to blind jump. Luck wasn't on their side, and they dropped out of warp in infected space. By the time they sent out a distress signal, it was far too late. They were quickly overtaken by an infected carrier. When I discovered what happened, I urged the Colonial Union to track down the infected carrier and kill it, but they refused to listen to me. Now that loathsome creature is running free out there. I know it's impossible to find the exact carrier that was responsible, but I can't rest until someone has claimed some justice for my friend's death. I'm offering 20,000 credits to anyone who can hunt down and destroy an infected carrier for me."||||45421||||2
WANTED: The Umbra||||For several Union-standard weeks, Carrier-class starship 'The Umbra' had been harassing a cargo storage station called the Abrium Galactic Warehouse. Over that period of time, The Umbra never penetrated the warehouse's defenses. The owner of the Abrium warehouse considered The Umbra a nuisance but did not bother sending a report to the Colonial Union. During The Umbra's most recent attack, however, it worked with another ship, breached the warehouse's defenses, and slew three workers before stealing a CU long range turret and an advanced fusion reactor. Reward of 5,000 credits, funded by Abrium Galactic Warehouse and an anonymous requester.||||45927||||2

Retrieve Data Pad||||"In the administration wing off Tram Gate D, there is a room that is often used for presenting ongoing research and prototypes of new technology. Inside, there is a data pad that contains a record of recent projects. To get into the room, there are three security doors that need to be opened, each with its own admin access card. I can't say where the cards have ended up now, but I presume that they were scattered around the research wing during the Code Black protocol. You'll need to find all three admin access cards, get through the security doors, and retrieve the data pad inside."||||53558||||5

They captured five members of the W.D. crew transporting the prototype and retreated to the planet Rivan-12. Enter their subsurface base, eliminate the last of the Alliance thieves, free the captured W.D. crew, and retrieve the stolen technology.||||62115||||3
The Forsaken Flagship||||"The W.D. flagship was entirely lost to the Infected. Its crew is presumed dead, and the ship itself remains in a sector of Infected space. It is beyond saving. But we cannot leave the flagship in Infected space. Our scientists have gathered some disturbing evidence as of late, in great part due to the mission in which you tracked down one of our offline security drones. We fear that if the flagship remains under Infected control, it could spell out disaster for our galaxy. Thus, I need a capable crew willing to enter the flagship and initiate its self destruct sequence."||||62116||||3
Report to Sullivan Vorcolp||||Your presence has been requested at W.D. Headquarters. Report to Chief Supervisor Sullivan Vorcolp in the Control Room to receive a classified assignment. Your security clearance has been upgraded to permit entry to the Control Room, which can be accessed through the short range teleporter on the upper level of the station.||||62122||||1
Additional Tasks||||"In the captain's quarters of the flagship, there should be a memory core on which are the schematics for the flagship's intergalactic warp drive. Should the situation with the Infected deteriorate further, we need a backup plan to transport our branch's most valuable assets out of this galaxy. Those schematics would help us immensely. Vorcolp also requires a scientific log from the flagship. Doctor Aina Petru, the Chief Scientist aboard the flagship, was thorough in documenting her research. It is likely she recorded her findings on the Infected before the ship was overtaken. Her work could be vital to combating the Infected in the future."||||65314||||3
Open Call||||The Caretaker of the Estate has requested any able crews to intercept a W.D. Corporation vessel in possession of dangerous cargo.

Break Out Conrad||||"Your first task is to rescue an associate of mine --  a human named Conrad. He was taken to to Hollow Rock, a high security prison that uses quantum technology to contain prisoners. Once Conrad is put in one of those cells, it'll be impossible to break him out. Luckily, he hasn't been locked up quite yet. We need to move quickly and intercept him while he's still being processed. You will have to infiltrate Hollow Rock, break into the holding room where Conrad is temporarily being detained, and give this device to him. It's called a P.U.N.T. Chip. He'll know what to do with it."||||65517||||3
Retrieve Robot Head||||"There was a group that had several hidden factories in this galaxy for manufacturing metal bandits, as well as a testing site where it produced some of its more innovative designs. There was one robot, a big guy, with a beam strong enough to rival starship weapons but much more compact. It's exactly the kind of beam we need. Go to the testing factory and bring me the head of the big robot. Then I can make some adjustments to its beam and use it to slice through the doors of the vault."||||65519||||3
The Madman's Mansion||||"I want something from Rowe's collection: intergalactic warp schematics for the W.D. flagship. You’ll need to sneak into Rowe’s mansion and unlock the secure cargo teleporter in front of the vault. Then Conrad and the modified robot head, which he’s been calling "the cutter", can be teleported directly into the mansion and slice through the vault door. Rowe’s defense systems will no doubt activate, so you’ll need to protect Conrad while he operates the cutter. Once the cutter has blasted through the vault door, retrieve the intergalactic warp schematics."||||65521||||6
Report to the Caretaker||||The Caretaker is impressed with your success intercepting the W.D. transport vessel. He thanks you for retrieving the W.D. prototype and wishes for you to bring it to him in person. You have been given access to the Captain's Quarters in the Estate, where the Caretaker resides.||||65530||||3
Remove Interference in Reactor Room||||"The flagship has been lost to the Infected. It is beyond saving. As a last resort, I initiated the flagship's self-destruct sequence. However, it seems that something tied to the reactor output is preventing the detonation of the nuke. That 'something' is likely the Infected flesh spreading throughout the ship, and it needs to be stopped. Remove the interference in the reactor room so the self-destruct sequence can proceed, and then get out of the flagship as quickly as possible."||||65905||||1

WANTED: Unit 10, Div #44||||W.D. Unit 10, Div #44 broke into a restricted W.D. Corporation factory and kidnapped several workers. Due to a zero-cooperation policy regarding extortion, the W.D. Corporation refused to abide by any ransom terms and now believes the kidnapped workers to be dead. Since the Corporation's security drones have been unable to capture or eliminate the kidnappers, the Grey Huntsmen have been enlisted to help. Unit 10, Div #44 is a Cruiser-class starship and is reportedly equipped with a strong shield generator and hull. Reward of 8,000 credits, funded by the W.D. Corporation.||||45414||||2
WANTED: U.S.S. Xarius||||Outrider-class 'U.S.S. Xarius' was recently discovered to be involved with a drug smuggling operation led by infamous sundust producer Tam Mora. After the U.S.S. Xarius had a falling out with Mora, its illegal activities were exposed to the Colonial Union Command Center through an anonymous tip. Xarius has since resisted arrest and destroyed all ships that attempted to apprehend it. Recent information has come in pinpointing a possible location of intercept between Xarius and a mercenary vessel called 'The Butcher', which is believed to have been hired by Mora to rid of Xarius. Infighting is expected. Reward of 7,000 credits for U.S.S. Xarius, funded by the Colonial Union.||||45410||||2
WANTED: U.S.S. Capalius||||Defectors from the Colonial Union Galactic Fleet of the ship ‘U.S.S. Capalius’ have been engaging in independent acts of piracy. Several civilian transport ships and W.D. vessels have fallen to U.S.S. Capalius, particularly along popular trade routes. U.S.S. Capalius is a Roland-class starship and is said to be outfitted with military-grade technology. Reward of 9,000 credits, funded by the Civilian Transport Association, Wolden-Dorf Corporation and Colonial Union.||||27370||||2
WANTED: Titan||||‘Titan’ is a Destroyer-class starship that abandoned the W.D. Corporation five Union-standard weeks ago. It has stationed itself around a valuable asteroid mining site, destroying any ship that gets within range. The asteroid is owned by Splitrock Mining Company, but with Titan in its current position, no vessels can get close enough to do their jobs. Based on reports of previous attempts to remove the Destroyer, Titan is said to be particularly difficult to damage. Reward of 10,000 credits, funded by Splitrock Mining Company and the Wolden-Dorf Corporation. ||||27367||||2
WANTED: The Striker||||Destroyer-class starship 'The Striker' is a stolen vessel. Its crew is known for hijacking security drones and other automated weaponry, and they are responsible for massive damages and casualties across the galaxy. Reports state that The Striker recently hacked into a pair of shock drones and has been using them to threaten civilian transports, attacking anyone who does not comply to its demands. Witnesses claim that The Striker is utilizing a lightning turret to attack in tandem with the shock drones. Reward of 9,000 credits, funded by the Colonial Union Sector Defense Division, the Wolden-Dorf Corporation, and the Civilian Transport Association.||||45416||||2
WANTED: Slapdash and The Torch||||A pair of unaligned vessels, ‘Slapdash’ and ‘The Torch’, have been terrorizing sectors around long range warp stations. Slapdash is a former racing vessel, and The Torch was a supply ship before it was hijacked by raiders and outfitted with heavy artillery. They have been attacking ships that are trying to reach long range warp stations for service. Every ship that has tried to put an end to their operation has been destroyed. Reward of 12,000 credits for both ships, funded by the Civilian Transport Association and the Colonial Union Galactic Warp Network.||||27373||||3
WANTED: Nebula Creeper||||Independently run scavenging ship ‘Nebula Creeper’ has risen in recent weeks. Though many scavengers in the galaxy seek out abandoned ships to scrap, Nebula Creeper hunts populated vessels and strips them clean after battle. Nebula Creeper is unaffiliated with a faction and has been targeting any ship that wanders into its perceived territory. Based on previous reports, distance is advised if possible to attain. Reward of 10,000 credits, funded by the Civilian Transport Association, Dark Star Navigation Inc., and the Colonial Union. ||||27366||||2

WANTED: The Umbra||||For several Union-standard weeks, Carrier-class starship 'The Umbra' had been harassing a cargo storage station called the Abrium Galactic Warehouse. Over that period of time, The Umbra never penetrated the warehouse's defenses. The owner of the Abrium warehouse considered The Umbra a nuisance but did not bother sending a report to the Colonial Union. During The Umbra's most recent attack, however, it worked with another ship, breached the warehouse's defenses, and slew three workers before stealing a CU long range turret and an advanced fusion reactor. Reward of 5,000 credits, funded by Abrium Galactic Warehouse and an anonymous requester.||||45927||||2
WANTED: Lortalus||||For the past three Union-standard years, the flagged Intrepid-class starship ‘Lortalus’ has been involved in numerous cases of sabotage and assassination. It is believed to be offering its services for hire, independently of and without regard for any faction. Though confrontations between Lortalus and the Grey Huntsmen have thus far been limited due to Lortalus’s elusiveness, one report speaks of the ship as being ‘deathly silent and virtually undetectable’. Reward of 18,000 credits, funded by the Colonial Union, the Wolden-Dorf Corporation, the Civilian Transport Association, Explorers United, the League of Free Machines and an anonymous requestor.||||27374||||2

Transport Cryo Chamber||||"A few hundred years ago, it was common practice to cryogenically preserve colonists and wayfarers during intergalactic missions. Cryo facilities were often constructed in fringe galaxies like this one to store and maintain the bodies until they were scheduled to be released. However, settling the frontier comes with great risks. Over the years, many cryo facilities were either destroyed or lost to time. It's my life's work to find them, and I believe I've located one in this galaxy. This cryogenic site, the coordinates of which I'll send to your starmap, may hold a colonist of great interest to me. If you collect his cryo chamber from the facility and bring him back to me, I'll reward you with 10,000 credits."||||14634||||3
Transport Alien Tablet||||"The Society of Intergalactic History made a deal with a businessman from another Alliance base. He was hired to procure an ancient tablet that may hold the key to decoding an alien system of hieroglyphs. The Society is willing to pay 6,000 credits for a ship to go to the station and retrieve the tablet for them. Once you've acquired the tablet, deliver it to Theod Vekius. He will fulfill your payment. He works for the Society of Intergalactic History and resides in one of the rooms in the orange-lit crew quarters of the Estate."||||13301||||4

The Madman's Mansion||||"I want something from Rowe's collection: intergalactic warp schematics for the W.D. flagship. You’ll need to sneak into Rowe’s mansion and unlock the secure cargo teleporter in front of the vault. Then Conrad and the modified robot head, which he’s been calling "the cutter", can be teleported directly into the mansion and slice through the vault door. Rowe’s defense systems will no doubt activate, so you’ll need to protect Conrad while he operates the cutter. Once the cutter has blasted through the vault door, retrieve the intergalactic warp schematics."||||65521||||6
The Forsaken Flagship||||"The W.D. flagship was entirely lost to the Infected. Its crew is presumed dead, and the ship itself remains in a sector of Infected space. It is beyond saving. But we cannot leave the flagship in Infected space. Our scientists have gathered some disturbing evidence as of late, in great part due to the mission in which you tracked down one of our offline security drones. We fear that if the flagship remains under Infected control, it could spell out disaster for our galaxy. Thus, I need a capable crew willing to enter the flagship and initiate its self destruct sequence."||||62116||||3

They are reportedly engaging with hostiles and taking heavy losses. We have also received reports of strange fires onboard our ships. We do not fully understand the nature of these fires, but early data suggests they generate oxygen which may also increase the risk of ordinary fires. It is advised to have fire extinguishers equipped in case you run into this phenomenon yourselves. Good luck, friends. If you plan to join the fight, report to the Horizon Bridge as soon as you are able!"||||114896||||1

Salvaging Parts||||“We’ve encountered issues with our machinery. Some vital parts of our factory’s systems are breaking down. Since the galaxy has been disconnected from intergalactic warp, we aren’t able to request replacements from the Fluffy Biscuit base hub. I had been mulling over our options for days, when I remembered that there once was a fourth Fluffy Biscuit factory in this galaxy. It’s quite possible that the abandoned factory contains duplicates of the parts we need.”||||36642||||4
Roy's Favor||||"Could you go over to the reactor room for me? I have a friend there named Am Cotoba. You see, I need a certain material called 'kilnseed' for one of my repairs, but it's pretty hard to come by on this ship. Cotoba uses it down in the reactor room all the time, so he might be able to spare some. Just remind him he owes me for helping him repair that panel he broke the other day. Let me know when you get ahold of that kilnseed, and I'll transfer 5,000 credits over to you."||||12612||||2

Retrieve Robot Head||||"There was a group that had several hidden factories in this galaxy for manufacturing metal bandits, as well as a testing site where it produced some of its more innovative designs. There was one robot, a big guy, with a beam strong enough to rival starship weapons but much more compact. It's exactly the kind of beam we need. Go to the testing factory and bring me the head of the big robot. Then I can make some adjustments to its beam and use it to slice through the doors of the vault."||||65519||||3

Near the administration offices, there should be an emergency medical station with supplies, just in case the regeneration atriums are down like they are now.

I know you have more pressing matters to deal with, but if you find the opportunity to bring Vilvard a dose of that medicine, it could mean the difference between life and death for him."||||55402||||3

Inside the supply room, there should be a medicine pack that I can use to patch up my leg. Would you get it for me?"||||86937||||3
Retrieve Data Pad||||"In the administration wing off Tram Gate D, there is a room that is often used for presenting ongoing research and prototypes of new technology. Inside, there is a data pad that contains a record of recent projects. To get into the room, there are three security doors that need to be opened, each with its own admin access card. I can't say where the cards have ended up now, but I presume that they were scattered around the research wing during the Code Black protocol. You'll need to find all three admin access cards, get through the security doors, and retrieve the data pad inside."||||53558||||5
Retrieve Alien Tablet||||"Ah, yes. You must be the ones that the Society of Intergalactic History sent from the Estate. Well, I have a bit of bad news. My crew had...problems acquiring the tablet. It seems some metal bandits have taken up roost in the structure where the tablet is located. My employees weren't able to get far without those bandits firing on them. They refuse to go back there. If you want that tablet, you're going to have to get it yourselves. I apologize for the trouble. At least let me forward the coordinates to your ship."||||13363||||2
Resupply Base||||"The Corporation needs a crew to deliver a crate of rations to a weapon production plant. From what I understand, the facility has also encountered issues with the native lifeforms as of late. The creatures have been burrowing into the ground and damaging the pipes, so they will need to be eliminated immediately to prevent any further interference. I advise you to locate them with a scanner as they tend to hide beneath the surface."||||24691||||3
Restocking Kilnseed||||"Roy sent you for kilnseed? That's great, but I'm afraid I can't give you any even if I wanted to. You see, I may have...uh...gambled away the last stores of it.

Please, I'll double whatever Roy is paying you. If I don't get this problem fixed discreetly, the Caretaker will wring my neck."||||12613||||3

When I discovered what happened, I urged the Colonial Union to track down the infected carrier and kill it, but they refused to listen to me. Now that loathsome creature is running free out there. I know it's impossible to find the exact carrier that was responsible, but I can't rest until someone has claimed some justice for my friend's death.

Break Out Conrad||||"Your first task is to rescue an associate of mine --  a human named Conrad. He was taken to to Hollow Rock, a high security prison that uses quantum technology to contain prisoners. Once Conrad is put in one of those cells, it'll be impossible to break him out. Luckily, he hasn't been locked up quite yet. We need to move quickly and intercept him while he's still being processed. You will have to infiltrate Hollow Rock, break into the holding room where Conrad is temporarily being detained, and give this device to him. It's called a P.U.N.T. Chip. He'll know what to do with it."||||65517||||3

Artifact Retrieval IV||||"A few weeks ago, I sent a team to retrieve a particular alien artifact, but they refused to continue the job. They claimed to have nearly broken their regeneration atrium trying to 'find the right path'. I'm not sure what they were complaining about, but I doubt it's anything you can't handle."||||104851||||3
AOD Sundust (Hidden)||||||||14791||||1
An Outside Deal||||"Do you know a man named Tam Mora? He’s the Estate’s resident sundust producer. I often buy my stock from him, as it’s convenient to run a stable business right here in the Estate. Lately, however, he’s been inflating his prices, and my profits are beginning to dwindle. On a whim, I decided to look outside the Estate for a sundust producer who’ll make me more than a 5 credit profit. Since I don’t own a ship, I need you to hop a few sectors away, meet with the new suppliers, and bring back the stock. Ah, and in fair warning, these new suppliers are a prickly sort. Try not to insult them."||||14790||||2
Additional Tasks||||"In the captain's quarters of the flagship, there should be a memory core on which are the schematics for the flagship's intergalactic warp drive. Should the situation with the Infected deteriorate further, we need a backup plan to transport our branch's most valuable assets out of this galaxy. Those schematics would help us immensely. Vorcolp also requires a scientific log from the flagship. Doctor Aina Petru, the Chief Scientist aboard the flagship, was thorough in documenting her research. It is likely she recorded her findings on the Infected before the ship was overtaken. Her work could be vital to combating the Infected in the future."||||65314||||3
